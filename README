== Qt OpenCV calibration tool ==

We need artists to test the new Qt OpenCV calibration tool.
This tool takes calibration footage and output lens parameters.
You'll need these parameters for accurate reconstruction.


=== How to Build ===

Install Qt, OpenCV and FFmpeg.
git pull https://github.com/Matthias-Fauconneau/libmv.git
cd libmv
 
Method #1: This will also build libmv, its dependencies and Qt Tracker
 
 make && bin-opt/bin/qt-calibration

Or Method #2: Build only the calibration tool

 cd src/ui/calibration && qmake && make && build/calibration


If you encounter problems, please mail me or ask for help on irc://irc.freenode.net/libmv
