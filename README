Libmv multiview reconstruction and tracking library
===================================================

Libmv is a simple multiview reconstruction library.

It is not ready yet. If you're interested in contributing, see:

  http://code.google.com/p/libmv

The short story:

 $ git pull git://github.com/Matthias-Fauconneau/libmv.git
 $ make
 $ bin-opt/bin/qt-tracker

Try loading an image sequence and start tracking. This UI may crash on you.
There's a reason we claim libmv is not finished !
