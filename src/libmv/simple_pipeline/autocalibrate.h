/*!
    Upgrade a projective reconstruction to Euclidean.

    The code assumes the projective reconstruction was done with normalized
    tracks; in other words, an approximate calibration has already been
    inverted.

    The algorthim is based on the one described in "Practical Autocalibration"
    by Riccardo Gherardi and Andrea Fusiello that appeared at ECCV 2010.

    \a keyframe1 and \a keyframe2 should have a large baseline.
