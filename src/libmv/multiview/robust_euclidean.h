/** Robust 2D Euclidean transformation estimation
 *
 * This function estimates robustly the 2d euclidean matrix between two dataset 
 * of 2D point (image coords space). The 2d euclidean solver relies on the 2 
 * points solution.
 *
 * \param[in] x1 The first 2xN matrix of euclidean points
 * \param[in] x2 The second 2xN matrix of euclidean points
 * \param[in] max_error maximum error (in pixels)
 * \param[out] H The 3x3 euclidean transformation matrix  (3 dof)
 *          with the following parametrization
 *              |cos -sin  tx|
 *          H = |sin  cos  ty|
 *              |0    0    1 |
 *          such that  x2 = H * x1
 * \param[out] inliers the indexes list of the detected inliers
 * \param[in] outliers_probability outliers probability (in ]0,1[).
 * The number of iterations is controlled using the following equation:
 *    n_iter = log(outliers_prob) / log(1.0 - pow(inlier_ratio, min_samples)))
 * The more this value is high, the less the function selects ramdom samples.
 *
 * \return the best error found (in pixels), associated to the solution H
 *
 * \note The function needs at least 2 points 
 * \note The overall iteration limit is 1000
