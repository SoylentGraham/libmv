Upstream version 1.5.0

Local modifications:

- Replaced IF (NOT EXISTS XXX) for GLOG and GLAGS with IF (NOT XXX),
  so we could specify librareis from our own third_party to be used by
  Ceres. We don't need full path to this libarries to build Ceres.
  Actually this should be quite safe for upstream as well.

- Added EXIST check around uninstall tagret specification, we don't have
  such specification in libmv, yet.

- Renamed Ceres's gtest library to gmock_gtest, so there's no conflict in
  library names. Not sure it'll give issues in the future (didn't check on
  whether our gtest and Ceres's gtest provides the same symbols), will
  figure this out later.

- Added "ceres" prefix to ceres tests targets, otherwise there was a
  conflict bewteen libmv's jet test and ceres's jet test. Change their
  path to ${LIBMV_TESTS_OUTPUT_DIR}/ceres. Alsotweaked path to data
  files.

- Do not modify cache's CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE and only update it
  for Ceres subfolder. Otherwise you'll have infinite appending of
  Ceres-specific flags on every saving of any CmakeLists.txt.
